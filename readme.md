# Artist Webpage

## About
    Front end only site with 4 pages.
    I created a website for my father who is a very skilled painter. He sells his paintings on various sites but didn't have one of his own. I created this to build a hub for his work and a place to find all of the sites that sell his work.

    This project provided a great challenge because it was my first taste of handling a client. When I showed my father the first draft of the site, he had many ideas to make the site his own. The biggest requests were to filter the images in the gallery and give details on whether the painting was available and link the sites where the painting was available. This forced me to take on some logic challenges to accomplish his requests.

## Future ideas
    I eventually want to link up the facebook photos to the gallery page so the gallery section will constantly be up to date with his finished work.

    I want to improve the filter because it is very messy js.

    Connecting to a backend language and database can help set up the contact form to store contacts and communicate with potential clients. as well as adding captcha api.
