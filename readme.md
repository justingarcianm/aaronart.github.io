# Artist Webpage 

## About
    Front end only site with 4 pages.
    I created a website for my father who is a very skilled painter. He sells his paintings on various sites but didn't have one of his own. I created this to build a hub for his work and a place to find all of the sites that sell his work.

## Future ideas
    I eventually want to link up the facebook photos to the gallery page so the gallery section will constantly be up to date with his finished work.

    I want to improve the filter because it is very messy js.

    Connecting to a backend language and database can help set up the contact form to store contacts and communicate with potential clients. as well as adding captcha api.
