# Artist Webpage 

## About
    Front end only site with slider, gallery, about, and contact pages.
    I creted a website for my father who is a very skilled painter. He sells his paintings on various sites but didn't have one of his own. I created this to build a hub for his work and a place to find all of the sites that sell his work.

## Future ideas
    I eventually want to link up the facebook photos to the gallery page so the gallery section will constantly be up to date with his finished work, as well as correctly sorting.

    I want to improve the filter js because it is vastly very messy.

    Connecting to a backend language and database can help set up the contact form.
